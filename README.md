<h2>100_Days_of_Code</h2>
<p1>For my Hundred_Days_of_Code: I have pledged to commit atleast one python project in this repository.
This will greatly help me enhance my skills as a software engineer.
Be on the look out for interesting projects to come.
Projects as listed:</p>
<h3> 1. Number guessing game </h3>
a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue
Skills: Functions, Loops, Conditions
<h3> 2. Dice Rolling Simulator</h3>
As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice. This program will generate a random number each dice the program runs, and the users can use the dice repeatedly for as long as he wants. When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate a random number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice).

The number will then be displayed to the user. It will also ask users if they would like to roll the dice again. The program also includes a function that can randomly grab a number within 1 to 6 and print it.
<h3>3. Madlibs Generator</h3>
The program design is such that it will ask users to enter a series of inputs that will be considered as a Mad Lib. The input could be anything, an adjective, a noun, a pronoun, etc. Once all the inputs are entered, the application will take the data and arrange the inputs into a story template form. Sound fun, right?
